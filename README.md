zp-branding
===========

A rework of zp-branding plugin for Zenphoto CMS for customization of backend.

Version number upgraded to **2.0** as plugin was rewritten and completely changed logic of operation, by getting rid of included custom Logo image (to protect files from being overwritten on the update).
Instead user can mix and match plugin Options to combine custom and default elements for their desired look.

**WARNING**
Backup your Custom CSS before upgrading!
 
**Options:**
 - Logo for Admin (Default, Custom, No logo) with ability to specify width and margins.
 - Background styling for Admin (Default image, Custom image, No image, Image repeat behaviour, Color)
 - Styling of Text and Links in Admin.
 - Custom CSS for further alterations.

Custom Logo and Background files should be placed in "/uploaded/design" folder of your Zenphoto install - see [UPLOAD FOLDER](https://www.zenphoto.org/news/path-constants/).
